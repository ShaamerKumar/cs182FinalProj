# Final Project From Shaamer Kumar and Ryusuke Suehiro

Contained in this repository is the main .ipynb file and a folder for the data we will be using to fine tune the dialoGPT model. Conversion.csv is the data for normal chatbot conversations whereas Customer-Support.csv is the data for real-life customer help questions to help our chatbot learn to speak and deal with customer complaints more carefully and compassionately.

This project's goal is to solve the problem of robotic chatbots in the airline industry, and provide a reliable, empathetic chatbot to deal with customer concerns.
